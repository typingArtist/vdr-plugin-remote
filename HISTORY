VDR Plugin 'remote' Revision History
------------------------------------

2002-10-14: Version 0.0.1

- Initial revision.


2003-03-31: Version 0.1.0

- Support autorepeat on /dev/input/eventX with following API-3 drivers:
  o DVB HEAD (2003-03-31 and later)
  o dvb kernel (2003-03-31 and later)


2003-05-16: Version 0.1.1

- Fixed key learning for vdr-1.1.31+.


2003-10-05: Version 0.2.0

- Simplified installation for av7110-based (aka full-featured) cards:
  o av7110_loadkeys is no longer required, but may be used anyway
    (for backward compatibility).
  o Integrated generic keymap support for all remote controls.
    No need to use remote-specific keymaps anymore.
  o Remote control protocol (RC5, RCMM), signal inversion setting
    and device address are automatically detected.
- Implemented internationalization.
- Dropped old (API-1) driver support.
- Updated plugin Makefile (re-created with vdr 1.2.5 newplugin).
- Minimum vdr version 1.1.32 or later.


2004-02-01: Version 0.2.1

- Implemented code to autodetect the remote control device.
  If called without parameters, the plugin will detect the receiver of the
  DVB card on event0/1/2/... automagically. This should make setup easier
  for people who have an USB keyboard or an USB mouse.
- Included workaround for kernel 2.6: Try to get exclusive access
  ("grab" device). Patching the plugin is not required anymore.
- Added some OSD diagnostic messages to make debugging easier.
- Included some patches in sub-directory 'misc':
  o DVB driver patch to set permissions for /proc/av7110_ir to 666
  o kernel 2.4 keybdev patch
  See README for details when these patches should be applied.
- Minor code clean-up.
- Makefile: added -D_GNU_SOURCE to make plugin compatible with vdr patches.


2004-04-22: Version 0.3.0
- New keyword '-i autodetect', Autodetect mode can be used together
  with other command line options.
- LIRC remote control (option '-l'). It just starts the LIRC code of vdr.
  Please note that I do not use LIRC and cannot provide any support.
- TCP/telnet remote control (option '-p').
- 'OSD' emulation for TTY (option '-T') and TCP remote control (option '-p').
