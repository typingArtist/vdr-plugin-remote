remote - Remote Control plugin for the Video Disk Recorder (VDR)
================================================================

Version:                      0.2.1

Written by:                   Oliver Endriss <o.endriss@gmx.de>

Latest version available at:  http://endriss.escape.bei.t-online.de/vdr

Requirements:                 VDR 1.1.32 or later
                              DVB or dvb-kernel driver (2003-03-31 or later)

Distributed under GPL, see the file COPYING for license information.


Description:
------------
This plugin extends the remote control capabilities of vdr.
The following remote control devices are supported:

(a) linux input device driver ('/dev/input/eventX', X=0,1,2,...)
    - built-in remote control port of the av7110-based DVB cards
      (aka full-featured cards), e.g. DVB-S Nexus [1]
    - remote control port of some budget cards, e.g. Nova-CI [2]
    - other input devices (?, not tested)
    See file FAQ for a list of cards which have been reported to work.

(b) keyboard (tty driver): /dev/console, /dev/ttyX

Notes:
[1] supported by DVB and dvb-kernel
[2] supported by dvb-kernel only


Installation:
-------------
The Remote Control plugin is installed the same way as any other plugin:
- cd VDR/PLUGINS/src
- tar xfz vdr-remote-0.2.1.tgz
- ln -s remote-0.2.1 remote
- cd ../..
- make plugins

Edit runvdr (or whatever script you use) to load the Remote Control plugin, e.g.
  vdr -Premote
will start the Remote Control plugin using default (autodetect) mode.


Key Learning:
-------------
When a remote control device is used for the first time, vdr will enter
key learning mode. Please follow the instructions on the OSD carefully!

For full-featured cards, you will be asked whether you want to use an
user-defined keymap. This keymap must be loaded with av7110_loadkeys
- *after* the driver has been loaded and
- *before* vdr has been started.
This way you can use your old keymaps if you are upgrading an existing
installation. Most people don't want to do this, and won't press a key here!

If you don't care about keymaps (or don't even know what a keymap is ;-),
the Remote Control plugin will now try to autodetect the remote control.
It will load a one-for-all keymap and detect protocol type and device address.
Please see note [3] below!

You will be prompted to press and hold down any key.
It is *important* to keep the key pressed until there is a OSD message that
- protocol ... has been detected or
- no remote control could be detected.

Note that the remote control transmitter can be detected only, if it uses a 
infrared protocol supported by the receiver hardware.
The receivers of the Nexus cards support the RC5 protocol, which is supported
by virtually all universal remote controls (try 'Philips' codes).

After key learning, entries like these will be added to the remote.conf file:
...
remote-event0._Setup     /proc/av7110_ir 00000000 18
remote-event0.Up         0000000100010021
remote-event0.Down       0000000100010022
remote-event0.Menu       0000000100010024
... 

If you have to re-learn keys, edit remote.conf and delete these lines.
(If you delete the file remote.conf, you have to repeat key learning
for all remote controls.)


Notes:
[3] Unfortunately, there is one severe restriction: Only user root may load
    keymaps with an unpatched driver. Therefore, the new autodetect feature can
    be used only, if
    - vdr runs as root, or
    - the driver has been patched using the patch in directory 'misc':
        cd DVB/driver/av7110
        patch < av7110_ir-permission-666.diff
    The patch will change permissions of /proc/av7110_ir to 666, so any user may
    load new keymaps. (Don't install the patch if you consider loading keymaps
    a security risc.) After applying the patch the driver has to be recompiled.


DVB and dvb-kernel driver (version 1.0.x, CVS DVB, CVS dvb-kernel) 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Remote control events are passed through '/device/input/eventX'.
(Since the /dev/input protocol is standardized in the kernel, there is a
chance that this plugin will work with other /dev/input devices, too.
However, this has not been tested yet...)
The -i option allows you to specify the name of the /dev/input device.

Before submitting a bug report, please verify that driver and remote control
are working properly. You may do this using the 'evtest' tool supplied
with the driver (directory 'DVB/apps/av7110_loadkeys' or
'DVB-APPS/util/av7110_loadkeys').
Verify that the device node exists and you have read access rights.

For testing or if you want to build your own keymap:
You have to select the correct protocol type, inversion setting and
keymap using the tool 'av7110_loadkeys'. Please read the file README in
the directory 'DVB/apps/av7110_loadkeys' or 'DVB-APPS/util/av7110_loadkeys'.
If you still have problems, have a look on the checklist in file 'FAQ'.


TTY devices
-----------
The -t option may be used to specify a virtual console as an input device.
This is useful, if you haven't compiled keyboard support into your VDR.


Summary of command line options:
--------------------------------
-i dev, --input dev   select device which supports the /dev/input protocol
-t dev, --tty dev     select terminal device


Examples:
---------
vdr -Premote
    Try to autodetect device '/dev/input/eventX' (X = 0,1,2,...).
    If no device can be identified, '-i /dev/input/event0' is used.

vdr -P"remote -i /dev/input/event2"
    use specified input device '/dev/input/event2'

vdr -P"remote -i /dev/input/event0 -i /dev/input/event2 -t /dev/tty10"
    use multiple devices


Have fun,

Oliver
