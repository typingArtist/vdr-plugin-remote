remote - a remote control plugin for the Video Disk Recorder (VDR)
==================================================================

Written by:                   Oliver Endriss <o.endriss@gmx.de>

Latest version available at:  http://endriss.escape.bei.t-online.de/vdr

Requirements:                 VDR 1.1.13 or later

Distributed under GPL, see the file COPYING for license information.


Description:
------------
This plugin supports the built-in remote control port of the DVB-S Nexus 2.1.
It is primarily intended for use with the new DVB driver (NEWSTRUCT and later,
i.e. API versions 2 and 3), but may be used with the old driver, too.

When the plugin is loaded for the first time, vdr will prompt you to learn
the keys of the remote control. It is possible to use several devices at the
same time, but this is not very important right now...

Supported kernel devices:
- new DVB driver (API-2 NEWSTRUCT, API-3): /dev/input/event0
- old DVB driver (API-1): /dev/lirc
- keyboard: /dev/console, /dev/tty..


Installation:
-------------
The remote plugin is installed as usual:
- cd VDR/PLUGINS/SRC
- tar xfz vdr-remote-0.0.1.tgz
- ln -s remote-0.0.1 remote
- cd ../..
- make plugins


API-2 NEWSTRUCT, API-3 driver:
------------------------------
Remote control events are passed through '/device/input/event0'.
Since the /dev/input protocol is standardized in the kernel, there is a
chance that this plugin will work with other /dev/input devices, too.
However, this has not been tested yet...
The -i option allows you to specify the name of the /dev/input device.

Before submitting a bug report, please verify that driver and remote control
are working properly. You may do this using the 'evtest' tool supplied
with the driver (directory 'DVB/apps/av7110_loadkeys').
Verify that the device node exists and you have read access rights.
You have to select the correct remote control type, inversion setting and
keymap using the tool 'av7110_loadkeys'. Please read the file README in
the directory 'DVB/apps/av7110_loadkeys'.

Note that, due to a firmware problem, autorepeat does not work with the
current driver. I hope that this will be fixed soon.


API-1 old driver
----------------
The old DVB driver provides a module (DVB/driver/lirc/lirc_dvb.o) which
connects to the LIRC device ('/dev/lirc', lirc_dev.o).
Using the -l option, it is possible to use '/dev/lirc' as a direct input
device, i.e. lircd is *not* needed. However, the lirc_dev.o driver
supplied by the LIRC package is still required (and must be loaded).
If you use this option, you should know what you are doing. :-)


TTY devices
-----------
The -t option may be used to specify a virtual console as an input device.
This is useful, if you haven't compiled keyboard support into your VDR.


Summary of command line options:
--------------------------------
-i dev, --input dev   select device which supports the /dev/input protocol
-l dev, --lirc dev    select device which uses the /dev/lirc protocol
-t dev, --tty dev     select terminal device


Examples:
---------
vdr -Premote
    use default device, same as '-i /dev/input/event0'

vdr -P"remote -i /dev/input/event2"
    use specified input device '/dev/input/event2'

vdr -P"remote -l /dev/lirc"
    use lirc kernel device

vdr -P"remote -i /dev/input/event0 -i /dev/input/event2 -t /dev/tty10"
    use multiple devices


Have fun,

Oliver
